This BSP should run only on or1ksim: the main simulator for or1k architecture.
or1ksim should be used for testing purposes.

svn co http://opencores.org/ocsvn/openrisc/openrisc/trunk/or1ksim
cd or1ksim
mkdir builddir_or1ksim
cd builddir_or1ksim
../configure --target=or32-elf --prefix=/opt/or1ksim
make all
make install
export PATH=/opt/or1ksim/bin:$PATH

Configuration file "sim.cfg" should be provided for complex board
configurations at the current directory (which you run or1ksim from) or at
~/.or1k/

The current sim.cfg file that configures or1ksim emulator to RTEMS/or1ksim BSP
is at the same directory as this README. You can also use or1ksim script from
rtems-tools/sim-scripts.

From command line type:

sim -f sim.cfg $PATH_TO_RTEMS_EXE

or (if you use a stable or1ksim release)

or32-elf-sim -f sim.cfg $PATH_TO_RTEMS_EXE

from sim-scripts:

or1ksim $PATH_TO_RTEMS_EXE

and then attach GDB to or1ksim from another terminal by running

or1ksim-gdb $PATH_TO_RTEMS_EXE
