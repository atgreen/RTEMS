/*
 * /dev/console for Hitachi SH 703X
 *
 * The SH doesn't have a designated console device. Therefore we "alias"
 * another device as /dev/console and revector all calls to /dev/console
 * to this device.
 *
 * This approach is similar to installing a sym-link from one device to
 * another device. If rtems once will support sym-links for devices files,
 * this implementation could be dropped.
