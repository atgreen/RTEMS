/**
 * @brief Task create extension.
 *
 * It corresponds to _Thread_Initialize() (used by the rtems_task_create()
 * directive).  The first parameter points to the currently executing thread
 * which created the new thread.  The second parameter points to the created
 * thread.
 *
 * It is invoked after the new thread has been completely initialized, but
 * before it is placed on a ready chain.
 *
 * Thread dispatching may be disabled.  This depends on the context of the
 * _Thread_Initialize() call.  Thread dispatch is disabled during the creation
 * of the idle thread and the initialization threads.  It can be considered as
 * an invalid API usage, if the application calls _Thread_Initialize() with
 * disabled thread dispatching.  Disabled thread dispatching is different from
 * disabled preemption.
 *
 * It can be assumed that the executing thread locked the allocator mutex.
 * The only exception is the creation of the idle thread.  In this case the
 * allocator mutex is not locked.  Since the allocator mutex is non-recursive,
 * it is prohibited to call the normal memory allocation routines.  It is
 * possible to use internal rountines like _Workspace_Allocate() or
 * _Heap_Allocate() for heaps which are protected by the allocator mutex.
 *
 * @retval true The thread create extension was successful.
 * @retval false A thread create user extension will frequently attempt to
 * allocate resources.  If this allocation fails, then the extension should
 * return @a false and the entire thread create operation will fail.
